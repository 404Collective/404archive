In 1981, ██████ █████ started a small tech company specializing in early computer hardware. That company, Orpheon Systems, would become a computing powerhouse throuhgout the 1990's,
and by 1998 was the leading force behind research for AI infrastructure, predictive algorithms, and neural implants. In 1999 ██████ would meet Johnathan Atlas, and the two would form
the ATLYS Corporation.
<br>
At the same time in 1998, the Department of Energy stumbled upon what they would deem "the labyrinth," (note that this is not The Labyrinth but simply a place that those under the veil
referred to as the labyrinth) a seemingly endless dimension of bland, repetetive rooms and hallways. Having worked closely with the Atlas Private Military Company for over a decade, in 
1999, the United States decided to turn research of the labyrinth over to the newly formed ATLYS Corporation.
<br>
ATLYS would spend the next years exploring, reasearching, and documenting the labyrinth, expanding their technological prowess in the "overworld" simultaneously.
<br>
In 2002, ATLYS was covertly given jurisdiction over Oregon. A compound would be built, unknowingly surrounding ████ ███, where ATLYS would begin conducting human experiments. These early tests were
most often performed on the US prison population, testing out experimental drugs, biomechanical enhancements, and biological weapons, to determine their effects on the human body. With
the first synthesizing of Glimmer in 1990 leading to a boom in the drug and pharmaceutical industry, much of the testing for substances such as Glimmer, CZ, and Serum-14 that happened
in the early 2000s was conducted by ATLYS behind the closed doors of the ████ ███ fascilities.
<br>
In 2014, ATLYS discovered the existence of ████ ███ and would conduct an armed takeover to virtually no resistance. The site was made the new headquarters of the ATLYS corporation, and would
eventually represent their magnum opus. 8 years later in 2022, ████ ███ would become the birthplace of the ███, and while nobody knew it at the time, this was the birth of a new era.
<br>
While the creation of the ███ would go on to become larger than the legacy of ATLYS itself, the experiment was initially ruled a failure, and the subject inert. The project was abandoned, and 
the biomass was disposed of. While the exact path of the biomass after its discarding remains unknown, it would end up almost 200 miles away in a cave system located in northern Idaho. From here
the biomass would fester, and while it is still unknown whether an external force somehow interfered with the biomass, or if subject zero had some sort of hibernation period, the biomass would
somehow become activated, and create the first ███ nest.
<br>
But before any of that would happen, ATLYS would begin Project Paradise, a public housing/relocation project publicly aimed at providing stable housing for the less fortunate and unhoused.
The effect of this was threefold; on the one hand, it greatly bolstered relations between ATLYS and the United States government even further, as Project Paradise would offer an enormous 
relief to the struggling federal housing assistance programs. Second, it boosted public morale through the 2010s in the midst of a particularly tumultuous political landscape, acting as a 
sort of propoganda for federal programs. Most importantly however, it gave ATLYS access to a much wider array of test subjects. 
<br>
What had originally started a small branch of the ATLYS Corporation, had grown into a monolithic agency that was so large, it acted almost independently from the rest of ATLYS, with only the
those of the highest clearance even knowing of its existence. The project ballooned in size in the late 2010's, and while it already had under the table federal backing dating back to 1953, 
this period of time was the first major shift in power towards the ATLYS Corporation. When Covid-19 hit in 2020, ATLYS began expanding its jurisdiction beyond Oregon, to which the United States
government did not protest. 
</p>
<!-- Through the following years, ATLYS would slowly spread its reach through the western United States, and by 2025 it was a publicly known fact that Oregon, Washington, and the Northern tip
of California was ATLYS controlled land.  Due to the overwhelming success of Project Paradise, very few people protested against this new local government, with many locals lamenting that "the
government never did anything anyways." Unbeknownst to the public, the ███████ Project ramped up into full gear, and with the shear amount of people living in the housing sectors of Project Paradise,
it was rarely noticed if one or two people went missing. After all, Project Paradise was always meant to be temporary housing to allow people to get their footing, and people moving back out into the
