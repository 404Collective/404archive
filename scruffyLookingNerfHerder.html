In 1981, ██████ █████ started a small tech company specializing in early computer hardware. That company, Orpheon Systems, would become a computing powerhouse throuhgout the 1990's,
and by 1998 was the leading force behind research for AI infrastructure, predictive algorithms, and neural implants. In 1999 ██████ would meet Johnathan Atlas, and the two would form
the ATLYS Corporation.
<br>
At the same time in 1998, the Department of Energy stumbled upon what they would deem "the labyrinth," (note that this is not The Labyrinth but simply a place that those under the veil
referred to as the labyrinth) a seemingly endless dimension of bland, repetetive rooms and hallways. Having worked closely with the Atlas Private Military Company for over a decade, in 
1999, the United States decided to turn research of the labyrinth over to the newly formed ATLYS Corporation.
<br>
ATLYS would spend the next years exploring, reasearching, and documenting the labyrinth, expanding their technological prowess in the "overworld" simultaneously.
<br>
In 2002, ATLYS was covertly given jurisdiction over Oregon. A compound would be built surrounding ████ ███ where ATLYS would begin conducting human experiments. These early tests were
most often performed on the US prison population,
